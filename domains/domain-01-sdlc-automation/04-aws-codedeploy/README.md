## Deployment Strategies Deep Dive

### In-Place Deployments
- Direct updates to existing instances
- Minimal infrastructure changes
- Suitable for development and testing environments
- Cost-effective but with potential downtime

### Blue/Green Deployments
- Complete environment duplication
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Easy rollback capabilities
- Higher cost but maximum reliability

### Rolling Deployments
- Gradual updates across instance groups
- Maintains service availability
- Balanced approach between cost and reliability
- Configurable batch sizes and health checks

### Canary Deployments
- Gradual traffic shifting to new versions
- Risk mitigation through limited exposure
- Automated rollback based on metrics
- Ideal for high-stakes production deployments

## Platform-Specific Considerations
