# Topic 3: AWS CodeBuild

## Overview
AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces ready-to-deploy software packages. This topic covers CodeBuild's architecture, build environments, advanced configurations, optimization strategies, and integration patterns with other AWS services.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this topic, you will be able to:
- Configure and manage CodeBuild projects with various source types and environments
- Design and implement buildspec.yml files for complex build workflows
- Implement advanced build optimizations including caching and parallel builds
- Configure custom build environments and container-based builds
- Integrate CodeBuild with CodeCommit, CodePipeline, and other AWS services
- Implement security best practices for build processes
- Monitor and troubleshoot build performance and failures
- Design scalable build architectures for enterprise environments

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Topic 1: Source Code Management and Topic 2: AWS CodeCommit
- Understanding of Docker containers and containerization concepts
- Basic knowledge of build tools (Maven, Gradle, npm, pip, etc.)
- Familiarity with YAML syntax and structure
- Understanding of AWS IAM, CloudWatch, and S3

## Estimated Study Time
**10-12 hours** including hands-on labs

- Compliance logging and audit trails

### 6. Integration Patterns
- CodeCommit integration and webhook triggers
- CodePipeline integration and build actions
- Third-party source integrations (GitHub, Bitbucket)
- S3 artifact storage and management
- ECR integration for container builds

### 7. Monitoring and Observability
