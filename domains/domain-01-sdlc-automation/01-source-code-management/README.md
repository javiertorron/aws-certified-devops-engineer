# Topic 1: Source Code Management

## Overview
Source Code Management (SCM) forms the foundation of any DevOps pipeline. This topic covers version control systems, branching strategies, code review processes, and integration with AWS services for comprehensive source code management in the cloud.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this topic, you will be able to:
- Understand Git fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Implement effective branching strategies for different team sizes
- Set up automated code review and quality gates
- Integrate source control with AWS DevOps services
- Design secure and scalable repository architectures
- Implement compliance and audit controls for source code

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of version control concepts
- Familiarity with Git commands
- Understanding of software development workflows
- Basic knowledge of AWS services

## Estimated Study Time
**6-8 hours** including hands-on labs

## Key AWS Services Covered
- AWS CodeCommit
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- AWS CloudTrail
- Amazon CloudWatch
- AWS Lambda (for automation)
