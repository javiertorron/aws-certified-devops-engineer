- **Technical Safeguards:** Access controls, encryption, audit logs

## Exam Relevance

This topic is crucial for the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional exam, particularly in areas of:
- Implementing compliance controls in automated deployments
- Monitoring and reporting on compliance status
- Integrating compliance requirements into CI/CD processes
- Automating compliance validation and remediation
- Managing evidence collection and audit support

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Preventive Controls
- Policy enforcement at deployment time
- Infrastructure validation before provisioning
- Access control automation
- Encryption requirement enforcement

### 2. Detective Controls
- Continuous monitoring of compliance status
- Automated compliance scanning
- Configuration drift detection
- Audit log analysis

### 3. Corrective Controls
- Automated remediation of compliance violations
- Policy-driven resource modification
- Access revocation for non-compliance
- Resource quarantine procedures

## Best Practices

- Implement compliance as code alongside infrastructure as code
- Use automated tools for continuous compliance monitoring
- Establish clear compliance ownership and accountability
- Regularly validate and update compliance controls
- Maintain comprehensive audit trails and documentation
- Integrate compliance checks into development workflows
